## Hi, I’m Leah 👋

I’m a product and go-to-market leader with experience across strategy, analytics, and platform work.

- Ex-Amazon (Retail, Payments, Catalog Quality)
- MBA, Cornell Johnson
- Background in fintech, marketplaces, and regulated environments

Here I experiment with:
- Lightweight data analysis
- Product thinking & workflows
- AI-assisted tools and prototypes

This is a learning space — not a software portfolio.
